This is a re-implementation of this paper.
[EDGNN: A SIMPLE AND POWERFUL GNN FOR D I - RECTED LABELED GRAPHS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08745.pdf)


* Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a powerful framework for representation learning of graphs.

* GNNs employ a neighborhood aggregation design that it aggregates and transforms the representation vectors of the neighboring nodes recursively to compute the representation vector of a node.

* The paper theoretically shows that there exist Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) as powerful as the (one dimensional) Weisfeiler Lehman algorithm for directed graphs with labels for both nodes and edges and edGNN model, is as powerful as the WL algorithm for graph isomorphism 

* This work is an extension of *Morris et al. ( 2018 )*

* Benchmark edGNN model on:
  * Graph classification task
  * Node classification task

The results of my re implementation for both the Node and Graph Classification task on the MUTAG dataset is near to the paper reported results. Also, My re implementation model performed well as well in both tasks.
